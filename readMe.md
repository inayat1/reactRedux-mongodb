## Why React

1. Fast - UI rendering is very fast even on large applications
2. Composable - Integrating components into one-another is very easy
3. Pluggable - Unlike other applications like AngularJS, react can be easily integrated with some existing application since it only manages the "view" layer
4. Isomorphic Friendly - can run on both client side and server side
5. Simple to learn
6. Battle proven - Since React is extensively used by Facebook, which is the world's one of the most high trafficking websites, it is secure to use for large applications

1. Node & npm - Packages
2. React - Components
3. React Router - Routing
4. REDUX - Data Flows
5. Webpack
6. ExpressJS
7. MongoDB
